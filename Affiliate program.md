Below is what I managed to prepare for a few hours with the ChatGPT and my previous research.

The topic needs further discussion.

**Mechanism for creating value:**
- Companies (AWS, Notion, etc) pay affiliate commission to partners for attracting clients. The commission is from 5% to 70% of the purchase amount.
- Ubiquity can become a partner of such companies and transfer affiliate commission to bounty hunters.
- For this bounty, hunters must pay with tokens.
 The token can be UBQ or a new one - UXP (Ubiquity Experience), KARMA (karma of the developer), etc.

**Mechanism for obtaining tokens:**
- As a bonus for the efficient completion of tasks by bounty hunters.
- Other options will be determined later.

**Mechanism for spending tokens:**
- Before buying a company product (AWS, Notion, etc), the bounty hunter transfers the appropriate amount of tokens to Ubiquity.
- The purchase is made through the Ubiquity affiliate link.
- After receiving the affiliate commission, Ubiquity transfers its amount to the bounty hunter.

**Fun part**
For the program, we can use the domain name with an allegory on GitHub - GiftHub.lol or GiftHub.dev

**Summary**
Essentially, a bounty hunter gets a discounts in exchange of our tokens.
Such a scheme has no direct cost to Ubiquity and creates utility for tokens.
